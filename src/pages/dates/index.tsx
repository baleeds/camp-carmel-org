          <h2>Traditional Summer Camps</h2>
          <p>
            Each traditional summer camp session is a wonderful opportunity to experience Christ-like community in a
            beautiful camp setting, while developing personally and spiritually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our grade ranges are based on a student's currently enrolled grade. If a parent feels that their child would
            thrive in a session different than their designated grade, exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis.

          <h3>Keeping Costs Down</h3>
          <p>
            We are able to keep our costs low thanks to the generous support of our partner churches, who donate funds
            to help subsidize the cost of camp. Additionally, our dedicated volunteer counselors and cooks help us to
            maintain a high-quality camp experience while keeping our operating expenses low.
          </p>
          <p>
            By making our camp affordable, we are able to welcome a diverse group of campers from all backgrounds and
            walks of life. We believe that this diversity enriches the camp experience for everyone and helps to create
            a vibrant and unified community in Christ.
          </p>

          <h3>Financial Aid</h3>
          <p>
            Camp Carmel believes that every child should have the opportunity to attend and experience the joy and
            growth that come from a summer camp experience. That's why we are grateful for the generosity of our donors
            who provide camp scholarships to families who may not be able to afford the cost of camp. Please contact our
            director, Erica Leeds, at <a href="mailto:campcarmel1952@gmail.com">campcarmel1952@gmail.com</a> for more

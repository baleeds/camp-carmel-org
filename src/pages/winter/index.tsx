            We understand that sending your child to camp can be a big step, and we want to provide you with all the

            <p>
              Our area of the Blue Ridge Mountains is known for unpredictable winter weather. In case of ice or snow
              that makes it dangerous for campers or parents to travel to Linville, NC, Winter Camp may be canceled,
              postponed, or moved to an alternate location.
            </p>
            <p>
              All pre-registered campersâ€™ parents will be notified promptly of any weather-related changes. Please use
              extra caution when driving in the winter, regardless of weather conditions.

              Packing for winter camp can be an exciting and sometimes overwhelming experience. In this section, we will
              provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to pack.
            </p>

            <p>
              All campers will sleep in the main lodge. Girls and female leaders will all stay upstairs, boys and male
              leaders will all stay downstairs.

          <CollapsibleSection header={<h2>Are campers allowed to have cell phones at camp?</h2>}>
            <p>
              We believe in the importance of unplugging and being present in the moment. That's why we are proud of our
              phone-free policy. If your camper wishes to have their phone for the trip to and from camp, we can store
              cell phones securely from check-in to check-out.

          <CollapsibleSection header={<h2>What should I expect at drop-off & pick-up?</h2>}>
            <p>
              All campers must be checked in and out at the lodge on top of the hill. The lodge is easily accessible
              from the main entrance of the camp.
            </p>
            <p>
              Winter camp drop-off time is at 5 pm on the first day of camp. For safety reasons, we require that parents
              or guardians accompany their children during the check-in process. During check-in, our staff will collect
              any medications, dietary needs, or other important information about your child.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pick-up time is at 10 am on the last day of your child's session. We ask that you arrive promptly to pick
              up your child. If you need to make special arrangements for pick-up, please let us know in advance.

            <p>
              We believe that healthy food is an important part of your child's experience at camp and we take pride in
              providing nutritious and delicious meals. If your child has any allergies or dietary needs, please let us
              know during the registration process so that we can make the necessary arrangements well in advance.

          <CollapsibleSection header={<h2>What if my camper has medications?</h2>}>
            <p>
              If your child has any medications that they need to take while at camp, we ask that you send them in their
              originally prescribed container, clearly labeled with your child's name, dosage instructions, and the name
              of the medication. This helps us ensure that your child is receiving the correct medication at the correct
              time.

            Camp Carmel believes that every child should have the opportunity to attend and experience the joy and
            growth that come from a summer camp experience. That's why we are grateful for the generosity of our donors
            who provide camp scholarships to families who may not be able to afford the cost of camp. Please contact our
            director, Erica Leeds, at <a href="mailto:campcarmel1952@gmail.com">campcarmel1952@gmail.com</a> for more
